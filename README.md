# alpha_waves_atari_st_source
Original Atari ST source code of Alpha Waves created by Christophe de Dinechin

source: http://cc3d.free.fr/Alpha-Waves.zip

some members of the Atari-Forum Community helped to get that some way compilable
https://www.atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=41821 (maybe someone with more Atari/Compilation knowledge can reproduce the source build and make a batch or shell script for doing it)
(its seems that my git version of the source is somewhay crippled with newlines etc. so start using the above Alpha-Waves.zip to reproduce the sucessfull build from the Forum post)
